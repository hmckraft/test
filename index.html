                    <h1>Hello, my name is Heather Kraft</h1>
                    
                    <h2>When asked what I do I identify as a designer, but I do many other things too.</h2>

                    <h3>Currently I am persuing a Masters Degree in Strategic Communication Design.</h3>

                    <p>I've wanted to go back to school ever since I graduated from my undergraduate degree. However, it's taken me 4 years to finally head back to the classroom. Only this time it's a different experience. My classes are collaborative and project based - this is an ideal learning environment for me.

                        At the moment I am currently working on teaching myself to code. This page will become an ongoing 'test' project.
